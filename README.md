# Hello,
I am a UI Designer living and working in Portland, Oregon. Checkout my portolio at <a href="http://tbdworkbench.com/" target="_blank">tbdworkbench</a>. My work highlights what I've been doing in Portland but does not cover all my passions. Living in the Northwest, the outdoors is a huge part of my life. Particularly snowboaridng, which is a passion that keeps my light buring 6 months out of the year. Checkout some of my adventures on my snowboarding blog <a href="http://bigflakesonly.com/" target="_blank">BigFalkesOnly</a>.  

Cheers, <em>-Tyler</em>
